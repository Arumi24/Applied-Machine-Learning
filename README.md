# Applied-Machine-Learning

Jupyter Notebook Programs for Applied Machine Learning course projects: Modules used extensively are **_numpy,panda, & matplotlib_** Data is seperated into a **_training set_** to train models and evaluated using the **_training set_**

## _regression.ipynb_

This notebook includes work I have done with **_regression_** and learning weights **_trained_** my using using **_stochastic gradient descent_**, as well as **_hyperparameter training_**(mostly used with **_ride regression_** penalty parameter to fight **_overfitting_**). I show the accuracy(**_Mean Squared Error_**) of my model prediction using **_test data_**.
On the last part of this project I analyze **_real crime data_** and learn parameter weights for various factors contributing to crime in certain areas

## _classification.ipynb_

This notebook includes work I have done with **_classfication algoriths_**. I have 2 sets of data, I start off by **_cleaning my data_** before processing it. I **_trained_** my model using **_K means clustering_** and well as **_Gaussian Discriminant Analysis_** and using my **_testing data_** evaluated my model using various measures that include **_Accuracy,Precision,Recall, & F-measure_**

## _supervisedlearning.ipynb_

This notebook includes work I have done with various **_learning algoriths_** that include **_Naive Baies, Decision Trees, Linear Support Vector Machines, & Non Specific Classification._**. I used **_real world data_** from yelp reviews and IMDB movie reviews, I **_preprocess & clean_** the data using binary bag-of-words vector representation and frequency-bag-of-words vector representation. I train these learning models and evaluate them on **_testing data_** I use an **_F1-measure_** for evaluation and show comparisons of the various learning algorithms
