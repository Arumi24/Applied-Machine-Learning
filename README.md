# Applied-Machine-Learning

Jupyter Notebook Programs for Applied Machine Learning course projects: Modules used extensively are **_numpy,panda, & matplotlib_**

## regression.ipynb

This notebook includes work I have done with **_regression_** and learning weights **_trained_** my using using **_stochastic gradient descent_**, as well as **_hyperparameter training_**(mostly used with **_ride regression_** penalty parameter to fight **_overfitting_**). I show the accuracy(**_Mean Squared Error_**) of my model prediction using **_test data_**.
On the last part of this project I analyze **_real crime data_** and learn parameter weights for various factors contributing to crime in certain areas

## classification.ipynb

This notebook includes work I have done with **_classfication algoriths_**. I have 2 sets of data, I start off by **_cleaning my data_** before processing it. I **_trained_** my model using **_K means clustering_** and well as **_Gaussian Discriminant Analysis_** and using my **_testing data_** evaluated my model using various measures that include **Accuracy,Precision,Recall, & F-measure**
